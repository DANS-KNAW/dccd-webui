Peter Brewer (Cornell University) developed the code for the conversion of dendrochronological data formats. Together with Esther Jansma and Ivo Zandhuis (Onderzoek & Advies voor digitale ontsluiting van culturele informatie), Peter Brewer also developed the international data-exchange standard TRiDaS. Kit Sturgeon and Steve Mohlke (The Epison Group, New York) developed TRiDaBASE, a stand-alone MS Access database for interacting with the DCCD web application. Rob Maijers (DANS) created the usability design of the web application. The on-line DCCD repository and user interface were realized by Paul Boon and Lodewijk Bogaards (DANS). Frans van der Zande (RCE) guarded the integrity of the DCCD architecture as the work progressed. Ronald Wiemer and Benjamin Dekkers (RCE) oversaw parts of the work at RCE. Rutger Kramer and Lodewijk Bogaards supervised the work at DANS. Dafne Jansen (Utrecht University) set up a Digital Collaboration Platform for DCCD-based research, education and outreach. \
